=*How to download and install eyeos 1.9.0.0 ??*=



==REQUIREMENTS:==

    Main requirements for installing eyeOS 1.9.0.0 

1)*SERVER*

    The main requirement for a new eyeos installation is a PHP compatible Web Server with PHP 5 or higher. We recommend to use a server with Apache Web Server and PHP 5. 

2)*CLIENT*

    Your browser needs to be standards-compliant and support CSS. This includes the common modern browsers

= *Details* =

1)Download the eyeOS tar.gz : wget http://downloads.sourceforge.net/eyeos/eyeOS_1.9.0.0.tar.gz

2)extract it : tar -zxvf eyeOS_1.9.0.0.tar.gz

We extract the eyeos eyepackage in the folder eyeOS/cd eyeOS tar -zxvf eyeOS1900.eyepackage

==*Editing Basics Settings:*==

We need to edit 'settings.php' to change the eyeOS root. The variable called REAL_EYE_ROOT is the name of the folder containing eyeOS filesystem. With WebInstaller?, this name is randomized to get more security.Choose a name and replace changeEYEROOT by it :

The code before (this is an extract):

/Paths define('EYE_ROOT','.'); define('REAL_EYE_ROOT','changeEYEROOT');

And after

/Paths define('EYE_ROOT','.'); define('REAL_EYE_ROOT','eyeOS');

We change the name of the eyeOS folder to make it match with REAl_EYE_ROOT

mv -v eyeOS eyeOS eyeOS' -> eyeOS'

The -v option is for verbose

Now, we need to put a password for user root and put a good date of creation. With EyeOS the password is hashed , here's command line to crypt your password and put it into root.xml Go to the accounts/rt4 directory then, type :

RootPassword?=YOUR_PASSWORD

where YOUR_PASSWORD is your root password

Then paste this code into the shell:

echo -n "$RootPassword?"echo -n "$RootPassword"|md5sum|cut -d" " -f1|md5sum|cut -d" " -f1>RootPass?.MD5 ReplaceRootPass?=cat RootPass.MD5 sed 's/'"changePassword"'/'"${ReplaceRootPass?}"'/g' root.xml > root.xml.temp rm -Rf root.xml rm -Rf RootPass?.MD5 date=date DATE=date --date="$date" +%s sed 's/'"changeCreateDate"'/'"${DATE}"'/g' root.xml.temp > root.xml

Now, we put the good rights to the folder

cd .. chown -R www:www eyeOS chmod -R 700 eyeOS

we delete install.php :

rm -rF /eyeOS/install.php /eyeOS/RootPass?.MD5
